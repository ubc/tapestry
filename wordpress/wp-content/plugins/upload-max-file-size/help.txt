Hello ,

I have made the plugin. this is working fine ...
But if you are getting wordpress error like HTTP error then after go in our plugin help folder and copy the all file from help folder and paste on your project root directory.Then after you can wait almost 2 to 3 days for updating this file on your server.it may be update within 3 days ...

The given solution is not for localhost ..If you are using my plugin on local host then you can go in php.ini file in your local server and change the upload max file size with also post size....


Note:The HTTP error is common error this is comming from wordpress.So our plugin is working fine .I have given you the solution of error....

Thanks 
Enjoy.......
